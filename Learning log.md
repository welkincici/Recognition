# Learning log  
### 2017.5.6  
We decide to use python to build the project. It will be based on neural networks and deep learning.  
OPENCV is efficient, but it may a little bit out of date. The recent recognition methods are mentioned above.  
To start our learning, we choose 'Deep Learning' as reference book, and use frame tensorflow and keras to practice.  
### 2017.5.7   
Tensorflow can help us learn some details of deep learning, and Keras is easy to use. Our plan is to study tensorflow first, and learn some about Keras after acquisiting basic deep learning knowledge.

Hongli Ni has acquisited a preliminary understanding of Python and is able to develop simple project with Python.

I start to read the tutorial of tensorflow. I learn several new concepts: tensor, cross-entropy and some algorithms. I am excited, because the tutorial clarifies the approach to develope machine vision in my mind (although just a little).   
The tutorial introduces a program that can distinguish hand-written numbers at the begining. The code is simple and clear: at first, define several vectors representing certain objects or concepts. At second, apply the softmax regression model.At last, use the training data to reduce the cross-entropy, which indicates the cost of the model.    
Emm.. I think I should manage to improve my English writing skills.

Today when I skim through the answers below the topic Tensorflow in zhihu, I meet a suggestion that keras is a better choice for researchers who want to build projects quickly and do not care much about the basic algorithm. I remember that the first program in tensorflow tutorial consists of a lot of mathematical algorithms. I think it is not necessary to acquisite all these algorithms, besides, I am not very interested in them.   
So I decide to change our plan. We learn to use keras first, and try to achieve basic function as quickly as possible.

Great work! You have got big advances. 
Which operation system do you use, windows or linux? Linux seems to be friendly for deep learning.

Resume updating!   
Get started with tensorflow. Try to get familier with basic components of tensorflow and understand their working process. Following are some important knowledge nodes.   
The most fundamental concepts of tensorflow are tensor and computational graph. The central unit of data in TensorFlow is the tensor, and a computational graph is a series of TensorFlow operations arranged into a graph of nodes.   
A TensorFlow Core program can be seen as consisting of two discrete sections:    
1. Building the computational graph.   
2. Running the computational graph.   

### 2017.8.3  
Learn how to write the simplist machine learning program : Linear Regression.   
In conclusion, a machine learning consists of two parts:   
1. Find symbolic derivatives
2. Change values of variables to minimize( or maximize, in short, to make these number idealize) symbolic derivatives according training data.        
   
Begin learning MNIST   

### 2017.8.4  
Finish MNIST for beginners    
A nice function to determine the loss of a model is called "cross-entropy."
MNIST is the "Hello World" in machine learning. It just a beginning.
