# Learning log  
### 2017.5.6  
We decide to use python to build the project. It will be based on neural networks and deep learning.  
OPENCV is efficient, but it may a little bit out of date. The recent recognition methods are mentioned above.  
To start our learning, we choose 'Deep Learning' as reference book, and use frame tensorflow and keras to practice.  
### 2017.5.7   
Tensorflow can help us learn some details of deep learning, and Keras is easy to use. Our plan is to study tensorflow first, and learn some about Keras after acquisiting basic deep learning knowledge.

Hongli Ni has acquisited a preliminary understanding of Python and is able to develop simple project with Python.   
### 2017.5.11
I start to read the tutorial of tensorflow. I learn several new concepts: tensor, cross-entropy and some algorithms. I am excited, because the tutorial clarifies the approach to develope machine vision in my mind (although just a little).   
The tutorial introduces a program that can distinguish hand-written numbers at the begining. The code is simple and clear: at first, define several vectors representing certain objects or concepts. At second, apply the softmax regression model.At last, use the training data to reduce the cross-entropy, which indicates the cost of the model.    
Emm.. I think I should manage to improve my English writing skills.
